<div class="title">5 Simple Tips for Fitness Success</div>


<div class="title sub">Exercise Daily</div>
<div class="para">Exercise daily for at least an hour. You do not have to kill yourself from running, jogging, etc.,
but you should have some sort of moderate physical activity in your everyday life. If you're looking to shed a few
pounds fast, do a higher-level intensity workout. For example, go on a walk at a brisk pace for an hour. Or, you can
jog and set certain intervals to sprint during that hour. Make sure you're not in severe pain during your workout.
Just a warning, your muscles will ache after a high intensity workout. It may be irritating, but that means your body
is changing for the better. Be sure to stay hydrated, stretch, and eat foods with a decent amount of protein after each
workout. The protein will help keep your muscles, not fat, rebuilding.</div>

<div class="title sub">Eat the Right Foods and Portion Each Meal</div>
<div class="para">No matter how bad your stomach is telling you to go for candy over healthy food, try to stay away from
sweets. Sugar from candy will not help you get in shape. Even if it's just a single candy bar, one will eventually lead
to another. Fruits and vegetables are the best thing to eat when getting into shape. Apples, for example, do a good job
at making the stomach feel full for up to 3 to 4 hours. Green vegetables such as green beans and broccoli keep the
digestive system clean and running. Also, stick to lean meats like turkey and chicken. Seafood, such as, shrimp, and
tilapia are also great alternatives. These foods are full of protein and healthy nutrients to help keep muscles fit
and ready for workouts. In addition, be sure to portion what you eat. Having a good metabolism comes from portioning
meals. Try to plan out eating six times a day and setting smaller portions, rather than having three large meals
throughout the day. This will also help you find yourself breathing smoother when working out rather than huffing
and puffing for air. This is because you will have less food in your digestive system, which means more energy is
used toward your exercise.</div>

<div class="title sub">Keep Track of Calories and Food Intake Per Day</div>
<div class="para">Keeping track of how many calories you eat in a day will be helpful in planning out your physical
exercising. Ever wonder why body builders' body masses are so big? That's because they plan out their meals and take
in more (healthy) calories than the average person. On the other hand, losing weight and striving for a skinnier
physique will involve more physical exercise than calories you ingest.</div>

<div class="title sub">Be Sure to Get Sleep</div>
<div class="para">Even though most of us have eight-hour jobs during the day or night, it is crucial to get enough
sleep to recharge the body's batteries. Six to eight hours of sleep will keep the body going throughout the day, but
if you happen to feel tired at any point after coming home from work, by all means take a small nap before exercising.
You should only nap for about a half hour. This will prevent you from staying up later in the night.</div>

<div class="title sub">Stay Motivated</div>
<div class="para">An important key to being in shape is to set goals and keep a positive mindset. If you stay positive,
you will be able to push yourself to get that fit body you've always wanted.</div>
